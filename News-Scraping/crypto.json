  "content": "<div>   <p>New York’s top crypto regulator is close to greenlighting a new stablecoin issued by cross-border payments company Ripple, FOX Business has learned.</p> <p>People close to the matter say the New York Department of Financial Services has indicated to Ripple it will approve the product and the company is eyeing a possible launch date of Dec. 4. If approved, as expected, Ripple will be allowed to legally offer its stablecoin called RLUSD to the public, positioning it as a major player in New York’s regulated digital finance market and the wider stablecoin ecosystem.</p><p>Press officials for Ripple and the financial services department, known by its acronym, NYDFS, had no comment. </p> <p>Ripple’s core business centers around its decentralized global payments network, RippleNet, which uses blockchain technology to provide faster, cheaper, and more efficient cross-border payment solutions for banks and businesses. It's billed as an alternative to the global bank settlement system called SWIFT. Ripple's native token XRP serves as a bridge currency to settle those transactions, but the token is currently in regulatory limbo in the U.S. as the Securities and Exchange Commission continues to argue in court that it's an unregistered security. </p> <p>The case, now in the appeals phase in the Second Circuit, could be dropped by the crypto-friendly Trump Administration once it assumes power in January. In the meantime, with its future uncertain, XRP has been subject to volatile price swings.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trumps-former-cftc-chair-eyed-crypto-czar-role\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>TRUMP'S FORMER CFTC CHAIR EYED FOR 'CRYPTO CZAR' ROLE</u></strong></a></p><p>In 2020, XRP’s price fell more than 50% and its market cap lost $16 billion when the SEC sued Ripple for allegedly violating securities laws by selling XRP without first registering those sales with the commission.

The NYDFS is known for its stringent approach to crypto regulation, ensuring that companies that want to offer digital assets meet a high regulatory bar, including fulfilling transparency, security and consumer protection requirements. Obtaining a limited purpose trust charter, which Paxos and Gemini have done, is one way for businesses in New York to offer specific services pertaining to digital assets without being subject to the more complex regulatory requirements of a traditional bank. Another is through a so-called BitLicense, which allows exchanges like Coinbase and Robinhood to facilitate trading and custody of crypto. </p><p>In June, Ripple announced it had completed the acquisition of Standard Custody &amp; Trust Company, a limited purpose trust company chartered by the NYDFS. Standard Custody will be the issuer of RLUSD upon regulatory approval. The acquisition helped accelerate Ripple’s stablecoin launch as Standard Custody was already licensed by the department to offer custodial services for digital assets upon acquisition.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/apps-products\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE</u></strong></a></p><p>Ripple is set to collaborate with <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/money\" target=\"_blank\">other payment providers</a> such as Bitstamp, Moonpay and Uphold for the anticipated rollout of its stablecoin next week. </p><p>\"For another well-capitalized, highly regulated player to enter into the global stablecoin marketplace – especially as MiCA regulation in Europe is about to be implemented – is a win-win and MoonPay is proud to provide access to RLUSD for our partners and customers on day one of Ripple's launch,\" said Keith Grossman, president of Enterprise at MoonPay.</p></div>",

It’s because it would be hard to make this kind of money in any other way today.”</p><p>While thousands of amateur investors such as Claire have reaped sizeable rewards in the crypto sphere, others have only lost money.</p><p>Mark, a cycling instructor for children from the north of England, started buying crypto in 2013. “The gradual acceptance of bitcoin by the legacy financial world boosted my confidence in it,” he says.</p><p>“But I’ve made endless stupid mistakes, had crypto stolen, lost my faith in bitcoin and sold it, then bought in again at a higher price. I’ve tried to trade and failed miserably. Since 2017, I’ve just left it alone and it’s the best financial decision I’ve ever made.”</p><p>Many respondents felt that a thorough understanding of blockchain technology and the crypto market are essential for successful investing. Others assigned their crypto riches to “nothing but dumb luck”.</p><p>Mitchell, from Minnesota, in his 30s and earning $100,000 annually in the tech industry, acquired 16,000 Dogecoin – touted by Elon Musk as the “people’s crypto” – for $1,300 between 2021 and 2022. It is currently worth about $6,000.</p><p>“I figured if it ever reached $100 a coin, it was an easy million,” he says. “Understanding crypto better now, I know that Dogecoin will almost certainly never reach those heights.”</p><p>In December 2023, having watched house prices rise faster than he could save, Mitchell took “a desperate gamble”, he says, and bought a single bitcoin for $42,000. In just under a year that investment has more than doubled to $90,000.</p><p>Mitchell now fears a “massive” crypto crash in the near future, but has decided not to sell for now.</p><p>“I guess I’m staying on this ride in the hope that analysts forecasting mid-$100,000s for bitcoin by the end of 2025 are right, though the biggest thing I’ve learned in the last four years is that no one making those guesses has any idea what they’re talking about,” he says.</p><p>“If they’re right, though, maybe I can finally afford that house.”</p></div>",

While Bitcoin is trusted for its strong security, it hasn’t moved far beyond being a store of value. </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-why-analysts-believe-xrp-could-reach-5-key-developments-explained\"><strong>Why Analysts Believe XRP Could Reach $5 – Key Developments Explained</strong></h2>\n<p>XRP’s price has more than doubled recently when it hit $1.48. This surge followed a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/16849140259338\">major legal victory</a> for Ripple Labs in its fight with the SEC. </p>\n<p>In July 2023, a U.S. court decided that XRP isn’t always a security when traded on exchanges. The news led to a<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/digital-assets/assets/xrp-xrp/\"> sharp 36% jump in XRP’s price</a>. </p>\n<p>Institutional investors have also taken notice and they decided to increase their stakes steadily over the past 16 weeks.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcJxpSN02480Cv-nv1kBhl959Zg2Xpcc4-5cD1VRE_GKAiXDRdBvOal4mk1PlGKhH8j5TdJvADgAlPIVYX5HffScuLa-r88t9InNmqtKBL73KFP6yR9ONT7p93_HGr4rjBdjyYySw?key=qCldTJ7d8gOwFf8CMo75y9yY\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>This progress has Finbold analysts feeling optimistic.

Ripple’s technology, which helps banks streamline cross-border payments, adds weight to these predictions.</p>\n<p>But XRP hasn’t had an easy road. For years, legal battles made investors wary. Many turned to safer bets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even now, concerns remain. </p>\n<p>The crypto market is unpredictable, and price targets depend on steady institutional backing and Ripple’s continued progress.</p>\n<p>For now, XRP’s growth gives it a chance to prove itself. If legal clarity holds and adoption grows, XRP might regain a spot as a top player in digital finance. </p>\n<p>Still, investors know this journey won’t come without risks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-plutochain-pluto-could-revolutionize-bitcoin-with-smart-contracts-powered-by-layer-2-innovation\"><strong>PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Could Revolutionize Bitcoin with Smart Contracts Powered by Layer-2 Innovation</strong></h2>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.plutochain.io/?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=cryptonews+flash&amp;utm_campaign=xrp+news+today%3A+analysts+predict+%245+target+following+major+developments&amp;utm_id=189\">PlutoChain ($PLUTO)</a> might be able to expand Bitcoin’s capabilities thanks to innovations that it brings to its network.</p>\n<p>This project adds smart contracts to the market’s biggest network, which could pave the way for its wider adoption beyond its transactional value.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdi_QrTzzojHmzsOgoAR32u6fGlvKNfbXSe_MQxziK8EtplQarOMJcEr6kMFThDVPhLo-yQDZ6YshGP49ZQp28mHOjKGQjHBPUfscBq179GctPFrY-5I9h-keBqKH11CsTWoy-nEw?key=qCldTJ7d8gOwFf8CMo75y9yY\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>Bitcoin hasn’t been a big player in decentralized finance (DeFi) so far, but this project could change that thanks to its hybrid Layer-2 blockchain.</p>\n<p>Now developers can make anything on Bitcoin’s network such as NFTs, AI, gaming, meme coins, and other projects – potentially expanding the possibilities of this blockchain.</p>\n<p>The team is working on a Layer-2 blockchain that could add smart contracts and DeFi tools to Bitcoin’s network.

The election of Donald Trump, although welcomed with enthusiasm by part of the community, does not erase the tensions.

However, disagreements persist: between hopes for clear regulation and ideological divisions, the landscape remains complex.

For many investors and enthusiasts, his rise to power represents a windfall: <strong>potentially favorable regulations and accelerated adoption of blockchain technologies</strong>. </p>\n<p>Konstantin Richter, CEO of Blockdaemon, sums up this dynamic well: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>” <em>Crypto is for everyone. It gives a voice to each one.</em> “</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, not everything is so rosy. Margaret Rosenfeld, a specialized lawyer, notes that several members of the crypto community could not ignore <strong>other controversial aspects of Trump’s politics</strong>. <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/trump-victory-divide-crypto-community\" target=\"_blank\">These disagreements</a> have resulted in virulent clashes on social media, particularly on X. </p>\n<p>Some notable facts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pro-Trump tweets <strong>accusing Democrats of being anti-crypto</strong> sparked heated exchanges;</li>\n<li>The “Crypto for Harris” campaign was attacked by Republicans, showing <strong>growing polarization</strong>;</li>\n<li>Some disillusioned individuals even turned to Bluesky, a booming alternative platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Far from unity, these divisions illustrate <strong>a paradox</strong>: Trump catalyzes both enthusiasm and tensions within the crypto community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-bitcoin-vers-un-futur-bipartisan-ou-politise\">Bitcoin: Towards a Bipartisan or Politicized Future?</h2>\n<p>The election of Trump highlighted a major issue: the <strong>politicization of Bitcoin</strong>. According to Natalie Smolenski, founder of the Texas Bitcoin Foundation, the surge in <a href=\"https://www.cointribune.com/en/crypto-markets/bitcoin-btc-en/\" target=\"_blank\">BTC prices</a> reflects <strong>investor confidence</strong> in Republican economic policies. </p>\n<p>But this dynamic raises a crucial question: <strong>can crypto remain apolitical?</strong></p>\n<p>For Dennis Porter, CEO of Satoshi Action Fund, the answer is clear. During this election, candidates opposed to Bitcoin largely lost due to their stance. </p>\n<p>” <em>Elected officials must understand that opposition to crypto could cost them dearly</em>,” he warns. </p>\n<p>However, <strong>excessive politicization could backfire on the industry</strong>. Smolenski warns: ” <em>Making Bitcoin a partisan issue creates enemies where there could be allies. </em>“</p>\n<p>Paul Ryan, former Speaker of the House, agrees: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>” <em>Democrats have misunderstood crypto. Their ideology has misread the expectations of the country.</em> ” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<figure><p>\nhttps://twitter.com/RyanSAdams/status/1854135822150238469\n</p></figure>\n<p>These criticisms reinforce the idea that Bitcoin, although universal in its essence, remains <strong>instrumentalized for political purposes</strong>.</p>\n<p>In sum, while Donald Trump opens new perspectives for crypto and <a href=\"https://www.cointribune.com/en/how-far-will-trump-drive-bitcoin-btc/\" target=\"_blank\">propels Bitcoin</a> to unprecedented levels, uncertainties remain. The sustainability of this “magic” will depend on other essential factors: high valuations, geopolitical tensions, and upcoming regulations. One thing is certain: the road to widespread adoption will be fraught with hurdles but also with opportunities.</p>\n<div><p>Maximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!
